Multiple inheritance in Python means that a class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent class. You can achieve this by defining a class with more than one parent class inside parentheses in the class definition. This lets the derived class access attributes and methods from all its parent classes. 

While this can make code more flexible and powerful, you should use it cautiously. Multiple inheritance can lead to complex class structures.
